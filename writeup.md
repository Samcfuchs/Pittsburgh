# Pittsburgh Homefinder


Our team chose to work on the Pittsburgh homes dataset, which provides a list
of properties throughout the city along with a number of helpful features,
including price, area, location, number of bathrooms, etc. The user that we
imagined interacting with our project was a person looking for a house in the
area--we aimed to enable broad exploration of the spectrum of available
properties as well as a detailed examination of one or two specific properties
that would be particularly appropriate for the user.
